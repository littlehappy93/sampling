# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...
    ```The quality of the sample is expected to be high due to the use of a stratified random sampling strategy. By ensuring representation across different provinces, age groups, and other demographic factors, the sample should be representative of the target population of eligible voters in Canada. This method reduces sampling bias and ensures that the opinions of various demographic groups are proportionately represented.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

Changes and Reasoning:
Likert Scale Adjustments: Added "Somewhat likely" to questions 1 and 5 to provide more granularity and capture nuanced responses.
Open-ended Clarifications: Added "please specify" to open-ended options to gather more detailed feedback.
Wording Adjustments: Minor changes in wording for clarity and better understanding.
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...No, the purpose of the survey could not be fulfilled through an observational study because it requires gathering subjective opinions, specific feedback, and direct interaction with voters to understand their priorities and preferences. Observational studies cannot capture these detailed insights and nuanced preferences necessary for tailoring campaign strategies.
    ```
